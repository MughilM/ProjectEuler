<p>Starting in the top left corner of a 2 x 2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/ProjectEuler\assets\Images\p015.png" alt="routeImg" /></p>

<p>How many such routes are there through a 20 x 20 grid?</p>

<h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>

<p>How do we start counting such a massive number? One thing to realize is that we can only move to the right and down. Therefore, for each point, we can only arrive at it if we passed through either the point to the right or to the north. If we had the number of routes to those two points respectively, then we can simply add them. Thus, we can gradually build a grid of route ways to each point, and once weâ€™re done, we just grab the number at the bottom right corner. Also, note that there is only 1 way to get to the points along the top row and left column, namely by either travelling only to the right or down, respectively.</p>
