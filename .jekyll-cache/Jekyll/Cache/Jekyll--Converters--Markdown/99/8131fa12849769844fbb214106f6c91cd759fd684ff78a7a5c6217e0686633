<p>Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of the fourth powers of their digits:</p>

<p>[\begin{aligned}
1634 &amp;= 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4
<br />
8208 &amp;= 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4
<br />
9474 &amp;= 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4
\end{aligned}]</p>

<p>As \(1=1^4\) is not a sum it is not included.</p>

<p>The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.</p>

<p>Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.</p>

<h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>

<p>This seems like it can be done with a simple for loop. However, how high do we go? Well, given \(k\) digits, the largest number we can have is \(k\) 9â€™s. The sum of the fifth powers of this number is therefore \(k\cdot 9^5\). Notice that if \(k=7\), the sum is \(7\cdot 9^5 = 413\,343\), a six-digit number. Therefore, it is impossible to have a number that is 7 or more digits long be a sum of fifth powers of its digits. Additionally, if \(k=6\), then the sum is \(6\cdot 9^5 = 354\,294\). In that case, we donâ€™t need to check numbers bigger than this.</p>

<p>Below is the code for the simple for loop necessary to solve this problem. For calculating the sum of fifth powers, we can convert the number to a string and loop through as seen below.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">limit</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">6</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">9</span> <span class="o">**</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">limit</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">sum</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">digit</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">**</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">digit</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)])</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">i</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The output after running is,</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>443839
1.5520538642324573 seconds.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Therefore, <strong>443839</strong> is the sum of all numbers that can be written as the sum of the fifth powers of their digits.</p>
