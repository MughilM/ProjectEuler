<p>If we are presented with the first \(k\) terms of a sequence it is impossible to say with certainty the value of the next term, as there are infinitely many polynomial functions that can model the sequence.</p>

<p>As an example, let us consider the sequence of cube numbers. This is defined by the generating function, \(u_n=n^3: 1,8,27,64,125,216,\dots\)</p>

<p>Suppose we were only given the first two terms of this sequence. Working on the principle that “simple is best” we should assume a linear relationship and predict the next term to be 15 (common difference 7). Even if we were presented with the first three terms, by the same principle of simplicity, a quadratic relationship should be assumed.</p>

<p>We shall define \(OP(k,n)\) to be the \(n^{\text{th}}\) term of the optimum polynomial generating function for the first \(k\) terms of a sequence. It should be clear that \(OP(k,n)\) will accurately generate the terms of the sequence for \(n\leq k\), and potentially the <em>first incorrect term</em> (\(FIT\)) will be \(OP(k,k+1)\); in which case we shall call it a <em>bad OP</em> (\(BOP\)).</p>

<p>As a basis, if we were only given the first term of a sequence, it would be most sensible to assume constancy; that is, for \(n\geq 2, OP(1,n)=u_1\).</p>

<p>Hence we obtain the following \(OP\)s for the cubic sequence:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Optimum Polynomial</th>
      <th>Sequence</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>\(OP(1,n)=1\)</td>
      <td>\(1,\color{red}1\color{black},1,\dots\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\(OP(2,n)=7n-6\)</td>
      <td>\(1,8,\color{red}15\color{black},\dots\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\(OP(3,n)=6n^2-11n+6\)</td>
      <td>\(1,8,27,\color{red}{58}\color{black},\dots\)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\(OP(4,n)=n^3\)</td>
      <td>\(1,8,27,64,125,\dots\)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Clearly no \(BOP\)s exist for \(k\geq 4\).</p>

<p>By considering the sum of \(FIT\)s generated by the \(BOP\)s (indicated in red above), we obatin 1 + 15 + 58 = 74.</p>

<p>Consider the following tenth degree polynomial generating function:</p>

<p>[u_n=1-n+n^2-n^3+n^4-n^5+n^6-n^7+n^8-n^9+n^{10}]</p>

<p>Find the sum of \(FIT\)s for the \(BOP\)s.</p>

<h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>

<p>This entire problem statement begs the question: <strong>How do you find the polynomial function given a sequence of terms?</strong></p>

<h3 id="finding-the-polynomial">Finding the polynomial</h3>

<p>The mentioning of “common difference” in the problem statement gives a good clue. Essentially, the method is: <strong>Keep taking differences of the sequence, until we are left with a common difference</strong>. Let’s call the number of times we take the difference \(t\), and the resulting difference \(d\). Then the coefficient of the \(n^t\) term in our optimum polynomial is exactly \(\frac{d}{t!}\).</p>

<p>Some intuition as to why this is the case. If you recall from calculus, taking the <strong>derivative</strong> of \(x^n\) leads to \(nx^{n-1}\). Taking it again leads to \(n(n-1)x^{n-2}\). We can keep going until the power becomes one, and we’re left with a number. That number is \(n!\). Additionally, a derivative is essentially a rate of change, and whenever we take differences between consecutive terms, that is basically what we are doing. When we see a constant rate of change (constant difference), that is the same as having a number as the derivative. And so we take the constant, but we divide by the factorial. Hopefully this clears up a couple of questions.</p>

<p>Anyways, once we’ve calculated this term, we subtract it off from the original sequence, and calculate the next coefficient. We keep going until the sequence is all 0s. I’ll show an example and it will become clear.</p>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p>Let’s say our sequence was <strong>6, 22, 70, 168, 334</strong>. The first step is to keep taking differences until we end with a constant difference. We keep track of how many times we do it:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>1st difference:</strong> 16, 48, 98, 166</li>
  <li><strong>2nd difference:</strong> 32, 50, 68</li>
  <li><strong>3rd difference:</strong> 18, 18</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, so at the 3rd difference, we encountered a common difference of <strong>18</strong>. Since it’s the 3rd, there is an \(n^3\) term in our sequence. The <strong>coefficient</strong> of that term is \(\frac{18}{3!}=\frac{18}{6} = 3\). So, the <strong>first polynomial term in our function is</strong> \(\mathbf{3n^3}\). Next, we subtract off \(3n^3\) for each value of \(n\) from our original sequence, and repeat the process again.</p>

<p>Subtracted off, we have \(\{6,22,70,168,334\}-\{3,24,81,192,375\}=\{3,-2,-11,-24,-41\}\). Having negative numbers is <strong>ok</strong>. Now let’s calculate our differences…</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>1st difference:</strong> -5, -9, -13, -17</li>
  <li><strong>2nd difference:</strong> -4, -4, -4</li>
</ul>

<p>Our common difference occurred at the 2nd level and is \(-4\). Thus, we have a \(n^2\) term, and the coefficient is \(\frac{-4}{2!}=\frac{-4}{2} = -2\). Thus, the second polynomial term is \(\mathbf{-2n^2}\).</p>

<p>Subtracting it off results in a sequence of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. We can see immediately that the first common difference is 1, and so we tack on an \(\mathbf{n}\). Subtracting it off one final time gets us a <strong>constant</strong> sequence of 4, 4, 4, 4, 4. Because we didn’t take a difference e.g. it’s at the “zero-level”, the last term is \(4n^0 = 4\).</p>

<p>Therefore, the polynomial which defines this sequence is \(\mathbf{3n^3-2n^2+n+4}\). In general, since this a cubic polynomial, we need at least 4 numbers in the sequence to find this. Now back to the problem at hand…</p>

<h3 id="back-to-the-problem">Back to the problem…</h3>

<p>So now, you’ve seen how we can find the polynomial function which defines the sequence. Since this was defined for \(k\) terms, we plug in the value \(k+1\) and chances are, it differs from the sequence. Since the long tenth degree polynomial has a term <strong>for each degree</strong>, the value will at \(k+1\) will be the <strong>first incorrect term.</strong></p>

<p>Now it’s just a matter of turning the above process into code. You can calculate the coefficients (and degrees) iteratively or recursively. I have gone with the iterative version. Additionally, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">numpy</code> package allows me to quickly calculate the values of the polynomial.</p>
