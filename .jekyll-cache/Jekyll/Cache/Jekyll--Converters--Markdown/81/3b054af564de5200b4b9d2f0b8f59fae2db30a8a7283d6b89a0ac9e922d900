<p>We shall say that an \(n\)-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to \(n\) exactly once. For example, 2143 is a 4-digit pandigital and is also prime.</p>

<p>What is the largest \(n\)-digit pandigital prime that exists?</p>

<h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>

<p>So the crux of this problem is reducing the number of pandigital numbers or the number of primes we need to check, because there is a vast number of primes less than \(10^9\).</p>

<p>Can we put a restriction on \(n\)? Well, remember first that an \(n\)-digit pandigital number has all the numbers from 1 to \(n\). Additionally, recall that if you add the digits of a number and their sum is divisible by 3 or 9, then the number itself is divisible by 3 or 9. Now, If \(n=9\), then it has 1,2,â€¦,9. If you add these digits together, we get 45. However, since 45 is divisible by 9, every 9-digit pandigital number is divisible by 9! So a pandigital prime canâ€™t be 9 digits.</p>

<p>We can do the same for an 8-digit pandigital number. The sum of the digits is 1 + 2 + 3 + â€¦ + 8 = 36. Hence, all 8-digit pandigital numbers are also divisible by 9, and thus canâ€™t be prime.</p>

<p>For 7-digit and 6-digit pandigital numbers however, the sums are 28 and 21 respectively, and thus we canâ€™t make any conclusions. However, the sum of the digits of all 5-digit pandigital numbers are 15, and so those are all divisible by 3. Therefore, we will generate all primes between 100000 and 7654321 (since that is the largest 7-digit pandigital number), and subsequently check each prime from the largest on down. The first prime we encounter that is pandigital will be our answer. Technically, I probably should also generate all 4-digit primes, but I was betting on the fact that the largest prime is either 6 or 7 digits long.</p>
