## About

Project Euler is a vast collection of problems ranging in all areas of mathematics, from number theory to probability. All problems are designed to be solved with programming, with the only submission being the answer. To see all problems, please visit [the archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives). In this website, I will list all of the problems that I have solved. 

### Format

So, each problem is a blog post, with the date being the date that I solved it. Generally, I try to solve the problems in numerical order, but due to difficulty of some problems, I may jump back and forth. Links to all problems in order are listed here (link TBD).
