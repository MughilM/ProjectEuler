## Question

Consider all integer combinations of $$a^b$$ for $$2\leq a\leq 5$$ and $$2\leq b\leq 5$$:

| $$a^b$$ | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    |
| ------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **2**   | 4    | 8    | 16   | 32   |
| **3**   | 9    | 27   | 81   | 243  |
| **4**   | 16   | 64   | 256  | 1024 |
| **5**   | 25   | 125  | 625  | 3125 |

If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the following sequence of 15 distinct terms:

<p align="center">
    4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125
</p>

How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by $$a^b$$ for $$2\leq a\leq 100$$ and $$2\leq b\leq 100$$?

## Answer

As the bounds are relatively small, and Python can handle larger than normal numbers, we can solve this through brute force directly. Python has a built-in `set()` data structure which automatically removes any duplicate elements, should you try to add them. Therefore, a simple double for loop would suffice:

```python
s = set()

for a in range(2, 101):
    for b in range(2, 101):
        s.add(a ** b)

print(len(s))
```

Running the above produces output in time at all:

```python
9183
0.02056965463349574 seconds.
```

Therefore, there are **9183** distinct terms in the sequence.
